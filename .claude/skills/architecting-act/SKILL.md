# Architecting Interview Graph Act

Design and manage Act (project) and Cast (graph) architectures through dynamic, context-aware questioning. Outputs `CLAUDE.md` at project root containing Act overview and all Cast specifications.

## When to Use

- Planning initial Act architecture (after `act new`)
- Adding new Cast to existing Act
- Analyzing Cast complexity for Sub-Cast extraction
- Unclear about architecture design

## When NOT to Use

- Implementing code → use `developing-cast`
- Creating cast files → use `engineering-act`
- Writing tests → use `testing-cast`

---

## Core Principles

**DYNAMIC QUESTIONING**:
- First analyze context (user request, CLAUDE.md, existing files)
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for structured option selection
- Skip questions when answer is inferable from context
- Group related questions when appropriate (up to 4 at once)

**NO CODE**: Describe structures only. No TypedDict, functions, or implementation code.

**DIAGRAMS SHOW EDGES**: Mermaid diagram contains all nodes and edges. No separate tables.

---

## Mode Detection

**First, determine which mode:**

- **CLAUDE.md doesn't exist?** → **Mode 1: Initial Design**
- **CLAUDE.md exists + adding cast?** → **Mode 2: Add Cast**
- **CLAUDE.md exists + cast complex?** → **Mode 3: Extract Sub-Cast**

---

## Mode 1: Initial Design

**When:** First time designing (no CLAUDE.md)

**Steps:**
1. **Interview Graph Act Questions** → [modes/initial-design-questions.md](./resources/modes/initial-design-questions.md)
   - Analyze context first, then ask only necessary questions using AskUserQuestion
   - Questions: Act Purpose, Cast Goal, Input/Output, Constraints (skip if inferable)
2. **Resume Ingestor Cast Design** → Follow "Cast Design Workflow" below
3. **Generate CLAUDE.md files** → See "Generating CLAUDE.md" section below
   - Create `/CLAUDE.md` (Act info + Casts table)
   - Create `/casts/resume-ingestor/CLAUDE.md` (Cast details)
   - Note: Initial cast directory already exists from `act new` command
4. **Validate** → Run validation script

---

## Mode 2: Add Cast

**When:** CLAUDE.md exists, adding new cast

**Steps:**
1. **Read CLAUDE.md** → Understand existing Interview Graph Act and Casts
   - Read `/CLAUDE.md` for Act overview and existing casts
   - Read existing `/casts/*/CLAUDE.md` files as needed for context
2. **Questions** → [modes/add-cast-questions.md](./resources/modes/add-cast-questions.md)
   - Analyze context first, then ask only necessary questions using AskUserQuestion
   - Questions: New Cast Purpose, Goal, Relationship, Input/Output, Constraints (skip if inferable)
3. **Cast Design** → Follow "Cast Design Workflow" below
4. **Create Cast Package** (if not exists) → Run command
   - Run: `uv run act cast -c "{New Cast Name}"`
   - This creates `/casts/{new_cast_slug}/` directory structure
5. **Update CLAUDE.md files** → See "Generating CLAUDE.md" section below
   - Update `/CLAUDE.md` Casts table (add new row)
   - Create `/casts/{new_cast_slug}/CLAUDE.md` (new Cast details)
6. **Validate** → Run validation script

---

## Mode 3: Extract Sub-Cast

**When:** Cast has >10 nodes or complexity mentioned

**Steps:**
1. **Analyze** → Use [cast-analysis-guide.md](./resources/cast-analysis-guide.md)
   - Read `/casts/{parent_cast}/CLAUDE.md` to analyze complexity
2. **Questions** → [modes/extract-subcast-questions.md](./resources/modes/extract-subcast-questions.md)
   - Present analysis first, then use AskUserQuestion for confirmations
   - Questions: Proceed Confirmation, Node Selection (multiSelect), Sub-Cast Purpose, I/O Verification
3. **Sub-Cast Design** → Follow "Cast Design Workflow" below
4. **Create Sub-Cast Package** → Run command
   - Run: `uv run act cast -c "{Sub-Cast Name}"`
   - This creates `/casts/{subcast_slug}/` directory structure
5. **Update CLAUDE.md files** → See "Generating CLAUDE.md Files" section below
   - Update `/CLAUDE.md` Casts table (add sub-cast row)
   - Create `/casts/{subcast_slug}/CLAUDE.md` (sub-cast details)
   - Update `/casts/{parent_cast}/CLAUDE.md` (reference sub-cast)
6. **Validate** → Run validation script

## Cast Design Workflow

**Use for all modes when designing a cast:**

### 1. Pattern Selection

#### 1a. Determine if AI Agent is Needed

**First, assess if the workflow requires AI agent capabilities:**

| Indicator | → Consider Agentic Pattern |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Autonomous decision-making | Yes |
| Tool/API access required | Yes |
| Iterative reasoning needed | Yes |
| Self-correction capability | Yes |
| Human oversight checkpoints | Yes |
| Multiple specialized AI roles | Yes |

**If ANY indicator applies** → Use [agentic-design-patterns.md](./resources/agentic-design-patterns.md) to select Agentic Pattern.

**If ALL are NO** (simple data transformation, deterministic rules) → Proceed to Step 1b.

**AskUserQuestion Format**:
```json
{
  "question": "Does this workflow require AI agent capabilities?",
  "header": "Agent Need",
  "options": [
    {"label": "Yes - Tool/API Access", "description": "External API calls, database queries, etc."},
    {"label": "Yes - Autonomous Decision", "description": "Dynamic routing, self-correction"},
    {"label": "Yes - Human Review Needed", "description": "High-stakes decisions, approval process"},
    {"label": "No", "description": "Simple data transformation, fixed rule-based"}
  ],
  "multiSelect": true
}
```

#### 1b. Basic Pattern Selection (for non-agentic workflows)

**YOU suggest pattern** using [pattern-decision-matrix.md](./resources/pattern-decision-matrix.md):

| Requirements | Pattern |
|-------------|---------|
| Linear transformation | Sequential |
| Multiple handlers | Branching |
| Refinement loop | Cyclic |

**AskUserQuestion Format**:
```json
{
  "question": "Which workflow pattern is appropriate?",
  "header": "Pattern",
  "options": [
    {"label": "Sequential (Recommended)", "description": "Linear transformation, fixed steps"},
    {"label": "Branching", "description": "Branch processing by input type"},
    {"label": "Cyclic", "description": "Iterative refinement until quality threshold"}
  ],
  "multiSelect": false
}
```

### 2. State Schema

**YOU design schema** using [state-schema.md](./resources/design/state-schema.md).

Present as **TABLES ONLY** (InputState, OutputState, OverallState).

**AskUserQuestion Format**:
```json
{
  "question": "Any fields to modify in the state schema?",
  "header": "Schema",
  "options": [
    {"label": "Looks good", "description": "Proceed with the proposed schema"},
    {"label": "Add fields", "description": "I need additional fields"},
    {"label": "Remove fields", "description": "Some fields are unnecessary"},
    {"label": "Modify types", "description": "Change field types or constraints"}
  ],
  "multiSelect": false
}
```

### 3. Node Specification

**Ask pattern-specific question** using [node-specification.md](./resources/design/node-specification.md):

**YOU design nodes** (single responsibility, CamelCase naming).

### 4. Architecture Diagram

**YOU create Mermaid diagram** using [edge-routing.md](./resources/design/edge-routing.md).

Ensure: All nodes connected, all paths reach END, conditionals labeled.

### 5. Technology Stack

> `langgraph`, `langchain` included. Identify **additional** dependencies only.

**Proactive Approach**: Analyze the architecture diagram to identify ALL technology choices user needs to make. Proactively ask about each relevant category using AskUserQuestion.

**Guideline**: For each technology category detected in the architecture (LLM providers, vector stores, databases, HTTP clients, file processors, etc.), create an AskUserQuestion with:
- Clear question about which option to use
- 3-4 common options with brief descriptions
- `multiSelect: true` if multiple tools may be needed together

**Example Format:**
```json
{
  "question": "Which LLM provider should be used?",
  "header": "LLM Provider",
  "options": [
    {"label": "OpenAI (Recommended)", "description": "GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo"},
    {"label": "Anthropic", "description": "Claude models"},
    {"label": "Azure OpenAI", "description": "Azure-hosted OpenAI models"},
    {"label": "Google", "description": "Gemini models"}
  ],
  "multiSelect": false
}
```

**Batch questions** when multiple categories detected (up to 4 at once).

**YOU determine** final packages + environment variables based on answers.

### 6. Validate

```bash
python ./scripts/validate_architecture.py
```

Fix issues if found, then present summary.

## Generating CLAUDE.md Files

Generate files using the EXACT template structure. Follow these steps precisely:

1. **Copy template skeleton** - Use template files as the base structure
2. **Use exact marker format** - See Marker Syntax section below
3. **Replace placeholders** - Substitute `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` with actual content
4. **Include all required sections** - Even if content is minimal
5. **Add MANUAL section** at the end for user notes

### Marker Syntax

**CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT marker format below. Do NOT use variations.

```markdown
<!-- AUTO-MANAGED: section-name -->
## Section Heading

Content goes here

<!-- END AUTO-MANAGED -->
```

For user-editable content:

```markdown
<!-- MANUAL -->
## Notes

Add project-specific notes here. This section is never auto-modified.

<!-- END MANUAL -->
```

**Common mistakes to avoid**:
- `<!-- BEGIN AUTO-MANAGED: name -->` - WRONG (no BEGIN prefix)
- `<!-- END AUTO-MANAGED: name -->` - WRONG (no name in closing tag)
- `<!-- AUTO-MANAGED section-name -->` - WRONG (missing colon)
